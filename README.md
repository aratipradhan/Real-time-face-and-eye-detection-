# Real-time-face-and-eye-detection
I've been working on an exciting project using OpenCV to implement real-time face and eye detection! Here's a quick breakdown of what I built:
🔍 Face Detection: Leveraging Haar cascades, the app identifies faces in a video feed and highlights them with blue rectangles.
👁 Eye Detection: Once a face is detected, the app zooms in and detects eyes within the face region, marking them with green rectangles.
📸 Real-Time Video Processing: The app uses a live webcam feed to showcase the detection in action.
💻 Key Features:
Accurate facial detection using pre-trained Haar cascade classifiers.
Labels like "Face" and "Eye" dynamically displayed on the video feed.
